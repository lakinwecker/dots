# dots
It's about time I figured out how to make my dots public.

## LICENSE
Some files will have their own license because they had one when I copied them from elsewhere. Those files are licensed under their respective license.  All other files in here are licensed under the unlicense.  

## CREDITS
I copied many of these from elsewhere. I never removed credits or licenses, but I also didn't actively add credits, so many files in here should be credited to other people but aren't. I'm happy to fix this if it's pointed out.
